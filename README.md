# ðŸŽ¤ Exploring the Top 5000 Albums on [Rate Your Music](https://rateyourmusic.com/)
Statistical analysis of Rate Your Musicâ€™s (RYM) top 5000 albums revealing key trends and insights.

---

## Project objectives

Manually collected data from RYM to build a dataset of the top 5000 albums. The goal is to fully scrape, clean, and analyze this dataset to identify key musical trends and patterns.

---

## Current status

- Initial data collection: manually downloaded HTML pages for 50 top album listing pages (as of May 19, 2025).  
- Next step: automate data extraction using BeautifulSoup to parse and clean data into CSV files for analysis.

---

## Data source

- Publically available [charts](https://rateyourmusic.com/charts/)
- Data currently limited to manually saved pages, as the website doesn't allow automated web scraping and its API is still in development.

---

## Key steps

1. Automate data collection via web scraping and HTML parsing  
2. Clean and structure the collected data  
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
4. Perform statistical modeling and hypothesis testing  
5. Visualize findings and generate reports

## Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- BeautifulSoup (web scraping)
- Scikit-learn (planned for modeling)
- Jupyter Notebooks

---

## Future plans

- Complete scraping of all top 5000 albums  
- Include additional metadata (genres, release years)  
- Analyze trends over time and across genres/artists
